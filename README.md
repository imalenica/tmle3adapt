> Targeted Learning and Variable Importance with Optimal Individualized Categorical Treatment

Description
-----------

`tmle3mopttx` is an adapter/extension R package in the `tlverse` ecosystem, that supports estimation of the optimal individualized treatment and the mean outcome under the estimated rule. In particular, it relies on the modern implementation of the Super Learner algorithm, [sl3](https://github.com/tlverse/sl3) and [tmle3](https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3) for the targeting step (Mark J. van der Laan, Polley, and Hubbard 2007, Mark J van der Laan and Rose (2011)).

In order to avoid nesting cross-validation, it relies on split-specific estimates of ùîº(*Y*|*A*,‚ÄÜ*W*) and *P*(*A*|*W*) in order to estimate the rule, as described by Coyle et al (Coyle 2017). In addition, the targeted maximum likelihood estimates of the mean performance under the estimated rule are obtained using CV-TMLE (Zheng and van der Laan 2010). The implementation supports categorical treatments, providing three different versions for the rule estimation. The goal of this work is to build upon the tlverse framework and the estimation methodology implemented for a single mean counterfactual outcome in order to introduce an end-to-end methodology for variable importance analyses.
